<p>We recommend two routes which you can find in the <a href=/download/explore-content/index.html>Content Browser</a>.</p>
<h2>Demo Model 1</h2>

<br/>
<br/>
<p>
  The model, generously donated by Making Tracks Ltd, reproduces the route between the Scottish capitals during the "blue" period of British Rail. 
  Your service is a morning express from Edinburgh Waverley as far as the town of Linlithgow, about 20 minutes running.
  The activity includes prompts to assist you as you move along the route.
</p><p>
  You can also watch a player driving the route on Open Rails in <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aZ5aVEvbOOE&feature=youtu.be" target="_blank">this video</a>, which provides a voice-over.

<br/>
<br/>
<p>
  This route, now a heritage line, comes with 7 tutorial activities which introduce you progressively to the challenges of
  managing a steam-hauled train.

<h1>Stand-alone Content</h1>
<p>
  Some content relies on the presence of files from MSTS, such as sound files and cab interiors.
  This is usually the case for free content downloaded from forums, so installing this content can be tricky.
</p>
<p>
  Content which has no such dependence (typically labelled as "stand-alone" or "mini-route") is easy to install.
  All the content in the <a href=/download/explore-content/index.html>Content Browser</a> is currently stand-alone.
</p>

<h1>Specific to Open Rails</h1>
<p>
  Although Open Rails will run any routes made for MSTS, many features and refinements are only available in content made 
  specially for Open Rails. Here are some examples.
</p><p>
  The Spanish websites <a href="http://viajerosaltren.es">Viajeros al Tren</a> and <a href="http://www.spaintrainzrutas.com/">Spain Trainz Rutas</a> are some of the first to offer Open Rails-specific products.
  </p><p>
  <a href="https://dekogames.com/wordpress/csx-mainline-power/">Deko Games</a> offer SD60M and SD40-2 locos with 3D cabs exclusively for Open Rails.
  </p><p>
  Some Australian routes (New South Wales) have been packaged by Peter Newell to work just with Open Rails:
